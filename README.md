My project name: About me

I create it using CSS JS HTML ( .eslintrc.json/.gitignore/license/rest.css)

I interact with users by asking them questions about me as a guessing game.

# lab-03

I will add some new features to my “About Me” project, as:

 I will create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML. page as an ordered list in HTML. 

 I will convert my work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML.
 I will add addtional CSS to style my HTML page.

As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner:
I add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
After all, attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with a guessing game.
I add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
 As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
